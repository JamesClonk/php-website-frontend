php-website-frontend
====================

The old PHP based frontend for my website, containing the moviedb and gamedb, written with CodeIgniter.

--

This is the old PHP frontend for the movie and game db part of my website. It relies on php-website-backend for fetching the JSON data from a MySQL database.
(Well, only the moviedb part does, the gamedb I never got around to rewrite to make it use the backend. It has remained standalone.)
